By \(\le\) we denote the (scattered) subsequence relation between words.
Example: \(aba \le baabbabbb\). Fix a finite alphabet \(A\). Let \(X\) be a set
of string variables. A subsequence constraint is an expression of the form \(x
\le \alpha \) where \(x \in X\) and \(\alpha \in X^*\).  A homomorphism \(h:
X^\ast \to A^*\) satisfies a subsequence constraint \(x \le \alpha \) if \(h(x)
\le h(\alpha)\). A domain restriction constraint \(d: X \to RE(A)\) restricts
the domain of possible values for a variable \(x\) to the regular language
given by the regular expression \(d(e)\). We are interested in the decidability
of the following problem:

Input: A set  \(C\) of subsequence constraints and a domain restriction \(d\).
Question:Is there a homomorphism \(h\) that respects the domain
restriction \(d\) and satisfies every subsequence constraint in \(C\)?
