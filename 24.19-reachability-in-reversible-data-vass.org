Is the reachability problem decidable for reversible data VAS where the set of data values A satisfy the following properties:

1. A is a homogeneous relational structure and has a linear order as one of its relations.
2. The embedding relation on finite substructures of X labelled with natural numbers is a well quasi order.

Some explanations: By saying A is a homogeneous relational structure we mean
that any isomorphism between two finite substructures of A can be extended to
an automorphism of A.

Examples: Dense linear order, random/Rado graph.

This question comes from the following paper with SÅ‚awomir Lasota:
