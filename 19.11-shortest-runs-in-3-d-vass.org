Is there a 3-D VASS with shortest run from source to target, which is longer
than exponential?  Best lower bound is exponential, best upper bound is tower.
The case of VASSes with finite reachability set is probably the core of the
problem.  In my point this is one of the problems we should attack if we want to
push theory of VASSes further.
