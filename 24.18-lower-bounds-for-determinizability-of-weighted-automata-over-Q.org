Although quite natural, the problem of deciding if a weighted automaton can be
determinized has only been solved in 2022 by Bell & Smertnig
[arXiv:2209.02260]. Following this decidability result, it is shown in
Benalioua, Lhote & Reynier [arXiv:2307.13505] that one can decide in 2EXPTIME
if a weighted automaton over the field of rationals is equivalent to a
deterministic one. It is shown in Jecker, Mazowiecki & Purser
[arXiv:2310.02204] that determinizability can be decided in PSPACE, when the
automata are restricted to polynomial ambiguity.

*Question:* Can one obtain lower bounds for the decision problem of
determinizability of weighted automata over \(\mathbb Q\)?
