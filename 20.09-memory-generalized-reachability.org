Given a regular language $L$ (on finite words), we consider the condition over
omega-words "having a prefix in $L$". We want to characterize the optimal
memory requirements for this condition over finite arenas.  The memory
requirements for the opponent were characterized by Colcombet, Fijalkow and
Horn in the 2012 paper "Playing Safe" (that also holds for infinite arenas).
