Moran Birth-death processes are stochastic processes defined as follows.
Consider a connected graph $G$ and a parameter
$r \in \mathbb{R}$ strictly greater than $1$.
We start with a partition of the vertices of $G$ into two types:
/mutant/ vertices, that have /fitness/ $r$,
and /resident/ vertices, that have fitness $1$.
At each step, a random vertex is chosen
with probability proportional to its fitness,
and spreads its type to an adjacent vertex
chosen uniformly at random.

With probability $1$,
the process eventually reaches 
either fixation of the mutation (all the vertices are mutant)
or extinction (all the vertices are resident).
The /fixation probability/ of a vertex $v$ of $G$
is the probability that the process starting with
a single mutant at $v$ eventually reaches fixation.
The fixation probability of each vertex of the complete graph on $n\in \mathbb{N}$ vertices is
\[
p_n = \frac{1-r^{-1}}{1-r^{-n}}.
\]

*Open problem:*
Does there exist a connected graph
$G$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ vertices such that
the fixation probability of each vertex of $G$
is strictly greater than $p_n$?
