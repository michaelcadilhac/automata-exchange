The weak validation problem is an open problem stated in 2007 by Segoufin and
Sirangelo. The problem is about checking if a regular langage of trees, seen as
a languages of word (with an XML encoding), can be /validated/ by a finite
automaton with the assumption that the input is a correct tree encoding.  More
formally, let $T$ be the set of words encoding correct trees, $K$ be a regular
language of tree with $\text{XML}(K)$ the associate languages of words.  Can we
decide if there exists a regular langage of words $L$ such that
$L\cap T =\text{XML}(K)$.

Weak validation sounds out of reach and a very difficult question although
generalisation of the problem considering extended version of finite automata
(e.g. Parikh automaton) could be in same time easier to deal with and provides a
more interesting class of weakly validating regular languages of trees.

Some recent work on a close subject:
