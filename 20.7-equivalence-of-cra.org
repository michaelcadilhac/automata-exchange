Consider the model introduced in [[file:19.1-ccra/][this problem]].  It is mentioned therein that
equivalence is undecidable for that model.  We ask what further restrictions we
can impose on that model to make equivalence decidable.

If the $\min$ operation is removed, then this is known to lead to decidability
[Alur et al.'13].  But as soon as we have $\min$, we don't know of a model with
decidable equivalence.

We conjecture that it is decidable is the CRA is /ordered/; this means that
the registers can be ordered, say $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, such that for all
updates, $x_i$ is only updated with registers $x_j$ for $j \geq i$.
