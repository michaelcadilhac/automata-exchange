The sequential flow problem (SFP) is a simple and natural reachability problem
which was initially formalized for solving questions related to population
protocols, but has independent interest. We now know that SFP is PSPACE-hard,
and in EXPSPACE, but its precise complexity remains open.  The following poster
gives more background.
