Consider the problem: given a matrix $M$ over integers, does there
exist a natural number $n$ such that $M^n$ has only non-negative entries? Is
this question as hard as ultimate positivity? Note that if you consider two
matrices $M, N$ and ask if there exists $n$ such that $M^n+ N^n$ has only
non-negative entries, that problem is indeed equivalent to ultimate positivity,
but with a single matrix, we do not know. Note also that if we ask strict
positivity of entries, the single matrix case becomes easy!
