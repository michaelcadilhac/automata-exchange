- Input: two timed languages $L$, $M$ represented as nondeterministic timed
  automata.
- Question: decide whether there exists a deterministic timed automaton
  recognising a timed language $S$ which separates $L$, $M$, in the sense that $L$ is
  included in $S$ and $S$ is disjoint from $M$.

The version of the problem when we fix in advance the number of clocks of the
separating deterministic timed automaton is decidable.  The open problem is then
when the number of clocks is not fixed (and thus quantified existentially).
