Branching Immediate Observation (BIO) nets are a subclass of Petri nets defined
by their transitions, which are of the form $|{}^\bullet t - t^{\bullet}| \le
1$. This multiset subtraction means that all input places of $t$ with arc weight
$k$ are also output places of $t$ with arc weight $k$, except for one which may
have input arc weight $k$ and output arc weight $k-1$. BIO nets generalize Basic
Parallel Processes (BPP) nets and Immediate Observation (IO) nets - a token can
“branch” into any number of tokens as in BPP, but may need to “observe” that
another token is in a certain place to proceed with its transition as in IO.

BIO nets have a non-semilinear reachability relation but a reachability problem
which is PSPACE-complete. This makes BIO nets the first natural net class with
non-semilinear reachability relation for which the reachability problem is
provably simpler than for general Petri nets.  Additionally, although the
reachability relation is not flat (in the sense of [Leroux, Sutre, 05]), it is
locally flat (specifically it is $pre^*$ flat) allowing the use of efficient
existing model checking tools with acceleration techniques like FAST [Bardin et
al., 03].

We think this is an interesting class, and we are looking both for application
domains for BIO nets (e.g. in the direction of chemical reaction networks) and
for consequences of this result in other domains that have problems connected to
the Petri net reachability problem (e.g. data nets, formal languages, process
calculi…).
