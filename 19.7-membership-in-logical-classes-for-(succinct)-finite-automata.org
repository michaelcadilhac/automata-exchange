Finite automata can be represented concisely in many way, including enriching
their description with bounded-size stacks and registers, by allowing them to be
two-way, etc...

Little is known of the complexity of checking membership of those representation of
finite automaton into logical formalism (such as LTL, First-Order Logic). Most
of the time, classical algorithms relies on testing algebraic properties of the
transition semigroup of the automaton. The transition semigroup itself is
exponential in the size of the automaton. A straight forward application of
those methods to concise representation will lead to tower of exponential
algorithms.

For specific kind of concise representations, smarter algorithms could lead to
only an exponential blowup.
