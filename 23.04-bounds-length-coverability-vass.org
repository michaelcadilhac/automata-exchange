By the classic Rackoff argument in d-dimensional Vector Addition System with
States (d-VASS) V if there is a path starting in configuration s and covering
configuration t then there is also a covering path of length at most M^k, where
M is the maximal number occurring on transitions of VASS and in configurations s
and t, while \(k \approx 2^d\).  Therefore for each fixed d there is a path of
length polynomial in M.

We conjecture that a much stronger property holds, that there is always a
covering path of length \(f(size(V)) \cdot (size(s) + size(t)\), namely
depending in some way on the size of VASS V, but only linear with respect to the
size of source s and target t.

I think this conjecture is hard to prove despite of a simple formulation and
progress on it could led to a deep understanding of runs of VASS.
