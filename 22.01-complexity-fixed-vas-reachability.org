A vector addition system is a finite set of vectors $V = \{ v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n
\} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d \in \mathbb{N}$.  Given two positions $s,t \in
\mathbb{N}^d$, a run of $V$ from $s$ to $t$ is a sequence $s = c_0, c_1, c_2,
\ldots, c_m = t$ of positions $c_i \in \mathbb{N}^d$ where each position is
obtained by adding an element of $V$ to the previous one: $c_{i} - c_{i-1} \in
V$ for every $1 \leq i \leq m$.  Is the following statement correct:

/Conjecture:/ For every vector addition system $V$, there exists a constant
$C_V$ such that for every pair of positions $s$ and $t$, if there exists at
least one run of $V$ from $s$ to $t$, one of these runs has a length smaller
than $C_V \cdot \big(||s|| + ||t|| \big)$.
