Given a Markov chain $M$, an initial
distribution $u$ and target distribution $v$, and a rational number $r$,
consider the problem of checking if there exists an $n$ such that $u M^n v
=r$. This problem is known to be as hard as the Skolem problem of LRS. However,
the reduction requires the Markov chain to be non-ergodic, in particular it is
reducible and periodic. If we now assume the Markov chain to be irreducible and
aperiodic (a natural assumption that is often used since forever!), does it
remain hard?! Both yes or no answers would be very interesting and have
consequences to model checking of probabilistic linear dynamical systems.
