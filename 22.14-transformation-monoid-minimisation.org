For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the full transformation monoid $T_n$ is the
set of (total) functions from $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ to $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, equipped
with the standard function composition.  The symmetric group $S_n$ is the
subroup of $T_n$ composed of all the permutations.  What is the complexity of
the following decision problems with respect to the parameter $n$:

/Problem 1:/ Given a submonoid $\langle s_1,s_2\rangle \subseteq T_n$
generated by two elements, does there exist an integer $m$ smaller than $n$ such
that $\langle s_1,s_2\rangle$ can be embedded in $T_m$?

/Problem 2:/ Given a subgroup $\langle g_1,g_2\rangle \subseteq S_n$
generated by two elements, does there exist an integer $m$ smaller than $n$ such
that $\langle g_1,g_2\rangle$ can be embedded in $S_m$?
