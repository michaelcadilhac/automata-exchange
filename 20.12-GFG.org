Valiant showed that the succinctness gap between deterministic and
nondeterministic pushdown automata (restricted to deterministic contextfree
languages) is nonrecursive, i.e., there is no computable function $f$ with the
following property: If the language of a pushdown automaton $A$ is deterministic
contextfree, then there is a deterministic pushdown automaton of size $f(|A|)$
recognizing $L(A)$.

Recently, good-for-games pushdown automata have been introduced, whose
expressive power is strictly between the deterministic contextfree and the
contextfree languages.

This new class of automata opens new succinctness gaps, i.e.,
- between deterministic pushdown automata and good-for-games pushdown automata
  (restricted to deterministic contextfree languages),
- between good-for-games pushdown automata and pushdown automata (restricted to
  deterministic contextfree languages), and
- between good-for-games pushdown automata and pushdown automata (restricted to
  good-for-games contextfree languages).


The extent of these new gaps is open, but Valiant's result implies that at least
one of the first two gaps has to be nonrecursive.
