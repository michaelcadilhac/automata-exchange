This problem comes from a typing problem (non structural subtype assignment).

Given a regular language R, does there exist a regular language U such that:
- U is an antichain for the prefix ordering
- $\forall u \in U, \exists r \in R, r < u < r^\omega$
- $\exists u \in U, r \in R, r < u < r^\omega \wedge |r^{-1}u| > ||U||$
where $||U||$ is the number of states of the minimal automaton recognizing $U$, and $r^\omega$ is the infinite iteration of $r$.

I conjecture that such language does not exist, though I don't find an approach
to attack it.  If such a language does exist, it would be interesting to know if
there can be an infinite number of words such that the third point holds or not.
