Is the following problem decidable: Given $A$, a weighted automaton (WA) over
the $(\min,+)$ semiring, answer whether $A$ has an equivalent deterministic WA?

/Remarks:/ The problem is equivalent when considering only automata with
weights in $\{0,1\}$ (a.k.a. distance automata).  The problem is known to be
decidable for polynomially-ambiguous WA.  For the general case of
exponentially-ambiguous WA, we don't even have any interesting examples where
determinization incurs a significant state explosion.
